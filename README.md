# FESTIM-NIUQ

A package of tools and scripts to perform Non-Intrusive Uncertainty Quantification for FESTIM code.

The package uses [EasyVVUQ](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/EasyVVUQ) and [SEAVEA-Toolkit](http://www.seaveatk.org/) to perform parametric uncertainties propagation for a tritium transport problem modelled using [FESTIM](https://github.com/festim-dev/FESTIM) framework.
